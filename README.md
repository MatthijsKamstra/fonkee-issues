# Fonkee Issues

![](icon.png)

Goal of this project is to make the transition from planning by PO/Project Manager, to working in gitlab with gitlab issues by Developers.

We should use the tools we are most familiar with, so for Planning/Estimates that would be sheets/Excel.

Because I don't like to repeat stuff done by others (DRY), I made an effort to convert data from sheets/Excel into information that work with gitlab (issues).

His should fix "problems" with

- Getting all the issues in Gitlab
- Getting all the issues with estimates (in Gitlab)
- And have a better idea of the planning via Gantt Planning in Mermaid (mermaid is a gitlab feature )

This is probably not the holy grail but if someone put time into creating a sheet with descriptions and perhaps estimate, it's an effort worth preserving and continue working on.

## how does it work

Working with Gitlab it's possible to import issues via `.csv`.

![](docs/img/import.png)

But this is a very limited csv format:

```csv
"title","description"
"one","description one"
"two","description two"
```

imported it would look something like

| title | description    |
| ----- | -------------- |
| one   | description one |
| two   | description two |

## using the limitation

After experimenting I found that this is flexible enough to work with:

**title**

- use sections for example ("UX Design - Flowcharts")
- emojis

**descriptions**

- hard returns
- emoji
- links
- markdown (gitlab version has checkboxes for example)
- `/estimate 3h` works during import and adds that to the issue

Example what is possible in description:

```markdown
yes import that also üëç

- [ ] one
- [ ] two
- [ ] three

Let's discuss this a bit,

oh and this

maybe more

And some more

üÜô

/estimate 4h
```

## Basic idea

How to convert sheets/excel to files that work gitlab.

You create an estimate based upon a predefined [template](docs/data/estimate_2021.csv).

It has

- Section : where is this component (example: `UX Design`)
- Title: what is it (example: `Flowcharts`)
- Description: some extra information (example: `We need to investigate`)
- Estimate: how much time to build (example: `4h`)

## Current state

Create default, basic `.csv` files via `src/ExampleFiles.hx`

- [estimate_2021.csv file with markdown examples](docs/data/estimate_2021.csv)
- [planning_2021.csv file with 2021 year planning](docs/data/planning_2021.csv)

Convert default `.csv` files via `src/ExampleMain.hx` to usalbe files for gitlab issues and mermaid gantt planning

- [estimate_2021.csv.converted.csv file for import into Giblab](docs/data/estimate_2021.csv.converted.csv)
- [planning_2021.csv.converted.md markdown file mermaid planning](docs/data/planning_2021.csv.converted.md)

Extra file is generated from the `estimate_2021.csv` into a Mermaid Gantt planning. This file is weird because you have not set the date, but a planning is better then no planning.

- [estimate_2021.csv.planning.converted.md file for import into Giblab](docs/data/estimate_2021.csv.planning.converted.md)

If there is no planning, the estimate is a fine way of getting the information into gitlab. Change the starting dates and its workable.

## (Gitlab) Issues

| Section       | Title      |     | Description | Estimate |
| ------------- | ---------- | --- | ----------- | -------- |
| UX design     | flowcharts |     | do          | 4h       |
|               | wireframes |     | do 2        | 4        |
| Visual design | invision   |     | x           | 8h       |

- `Section` is added from the first time it appears, needs to start with section
- `Title` needed (no title, no entry in export)
- `Description` can have markdown features and enters for next lines.
- `Estimates` in 4, 4h, 4d 4w

this sheet information will be translated to an csv you can import into gitlab

| title                    | description          |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- |
| UX design - flowcharts   | do \n /estimate 4h   |
| UX design - wireframes   | do 2 \n /estimate 4h |
| Visual design - invision | x \n /estimate 8h    |

## Mermaid

gantt for planning

https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/gantt

sheet specs

| Phase  | Title      | week 10 | week 11 |
| ------ | ---------- | ------- | ------- |
|        |            | 1 maart | 8 maart |
| Server | Acceptance | x       |         |
|        | Production |         | x       |

Phase will group the different titles in sections. And will be repeated if not set (in our example: `acceptance` and `production` will be in the section `Server`)

## Gant example

````mermaid
gantt
    title A Gantt Diagram
    %% this is a comment
    dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD
    excludes    weekends

    section Section
    A task           :a1, 2014-01-01, 30d
    Another task     :after a1  , 20d
    section Another
    Task in sec      :2014-01-12  , 12d
    another task      : 24d
    ```
